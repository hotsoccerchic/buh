        		<h1>The Strange World of Beetle Smuggling</h1>
			<img src="https://mediaprocessor.websimages.com/fit/1920x1920/8-bitbeetles-com.webs.com/kingdom2-2.jpg" width="50%" height="50%">
				<p>Transportation by air and boat permits the establishment of foreign beetles in the region they are transported to whether or not it is legal. National plant quarantine services, wildlife protection agencies and ecologists work hard to prevent this from occurring. It is important to protect the ecosystem from negative man-made side effects, but unfortunately officials cannot stop what has already happened. 
<br>
<br>

Beetle smugglers usually cannot be detected unless an inspectors sees the beetles with their own eyes. By the early 2000's, there were significantly more smugglers than inspectors in Japan. The number of foreign beetle species was overflowing the borders- many people would go on tours to other countries and bring live specimens of many species back home illegally. 
<br>
<br>

A Japanese entomologist returning from a tour of New Zealand tried to smuggle 12 endemic beetles but was caught by wildlife protection agency officials. “Insects from around the world featured on the list ranged in price from €150 to €1,500.” (Kyodo)
<br>
					<br>
The mass transportation of beetles is a problem for both the country of export and the country of import. If too many specimens of a potentially endemic species are captured from the wild, it may result in the extinction of that local population.

<br>
<br>
In another case in 2001, two Japanese men were arrested on August 1 at Nepal’s Tribhuvan International Airport shortly before boarding a flight for Osaka for attempting to smuggle 271 pairs of indigenous stag beetles out of the country (Stanton). 271 pairs mean 542 individual stag beetles which is an absurd, ecologically damaging number of specimens for illegal export.</p>
