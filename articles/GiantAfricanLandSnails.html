        		<h1>MOLLUSCS OF TERROR: GIANT AFRICAN LAND SNAILS</h1>
			<img src="https://i.ibb.co/sqJpKSn/10496129-325994870909733-248096753266329977-o.jpg" width="50%" height="50%">
				<p>In 1966, a boy brought three giant African land snails into Florida. 
His grandmother released them into a garden which resulted in a population explosion of more than 18,000 giant African land snails 7 years later. 

It took 10 years to eradicate them at a cost of $1,000,000.
					<br>
					<br>
					Giant African Land Snails (GALS) have been described as one of the most successful invasive species on the planet. Due to the high risk of their establishment in non-native regions as well as their potential effects on human health, the importation of GALS into the U.S. is not permitted and they are illegal to keep as pets in the country. 

<br>
					<br>

The main reason for keeping GALS illegal is their enormous appetite that includes over 500 plant species. On top of that, GALS are also fecund   hermaphrodites, so each individual contains male and female reproductive organs. 

<br>
					<br>

In 1966, a boy in Miami brought three giant African land snails into the country. For whatever reason, his grandmother released them into a garden, free to roam about and mate at will. 
<br>
					<br>
GALS can lay up to 1,200 eggs a year depending on the species. Seven years after the release of these 3 snails, the original population of 3 grew to more than 18,000 meaty mollusks leaving heavy trails of mucus and devouring everything from plants to peeling house paint across the state. The Florida state eradication effort took 10 years at a cost of $1 million.
The individuals involved in the eradication effort at the time prevented further destruction as well as the establishment of GALS in the United States. National ecological disaster avoided? Maybe.  
	<br>
					<br>
					Although there are no documented health issues from GALS in the United States, they do pose a risk to human health because they can be infected with a parasite that can cause meningitis. It's unknown if any of the snails already in the continental U.S. are infected, but unless you're eating gigantic snails (not recommended) that have themselves consumed infected rat stool, the likelihood of a health issue with GALS is very low. It is unknown whether or not their slime can contain the infectious organisms. It also may be significant to note that all snails can carry salmonella and other bacteria. 
In recent decades, USDA APHIS networked with GALS owners and dealers in the United States to eliminate as many as possible in captivity. Several state pest management websites say that GALS owners are not penalized if they claim their snail to officials for confiscation. As of August 29th 2014, APHIS has seized at least 1,237 GALS in captivity.
