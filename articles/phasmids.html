        		<h1>Phasmids: The Ecological Impact of Stick Insects</h1>

				<p>Phasmids, commonly known as stick insects, are some of the longest insects on the planet. Some species of stick insect occur naturally in the United States and few American species are actually quite large, such as Megaphasma dentricus and  Anisomorpha buprestoides.
<br>
					<br>
Many species of stick insects are parthenogenic which means that females can produce viable offspring without mating. So if one adult female or ova gets released into a welcoming environment, she can produce hundreds of daughters without having mated with a male. This allows for their quick proliferation in high numbers, as one adult female can lay hundreds of daughter ova. 
<br>
					<br>
					Indian walking sticks now inhabit California landscapes as a result of their escape from captivity and the disposal of their ova. [2] Relative to some other phasmid species Indian walking sticks are not very big, but the establishment of a large species like Heteropteryx dilatata would be a living nightmare for most Americans.
<br>
<br>
Stick insects also consume copious amounts of live plant leaves, usually bramble or oak. For these reasons, non-native stick insects (and their ova) should never be released into the wild due to the risk of their establishment and their potential to cause damage to an ecosystem where they are not normally found.</p>
