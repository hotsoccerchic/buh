        		<h1>Beetle Mania: The History and World Records of Beetle Breeding</h1>

				<p>In Japan, beetle breeding is a common hobby and a substantial industry has existed for decades. Many southeastern Asian countries as well as European countries like Germany and Belgium also partake in the hobby of exotic beetle breeding. 
<br>Beetle collecting goes as far back as curious children do, but Japan's current industry is a particular case. Most countries have tight restrictions when it comes to allowing the free import of exotic species, Japan included. Yet, there is currently a multi-million dollar industry that revolves around the importation of exotic beetle species.
<br>“Among the 1,200 species described so far, only 35 are found in Japan. The stag beetle mania originated with an arcade game called Mushi (insect) King, in which players collect cards of virtual stag beetles as ﬁghters in tournaments. From card and virtual beetles, the passion has led to collection of real insects. Their immense morphological variety and the highly visual combats performed by males makes them both interesting collected items and valued pets.” (Pierline)


<br>
In Japan during the early 90's, the culture began to develop further as people researched the life cycle of beetles in order to achieve larger sizes. Different shapes and morphs of beetle species also began to emerge from beetle breeding workshops. 
<br>


Soon during the later half of the 1990's the beetle boom spread into Korea and China. Eventually, Japanese breeders became dissatisfied with their thirty-five native stag beetle species. In 2004, people were illegally importing foreign beetles in amounts that were several factors greater than what they were in the 90's.
<br>


“Over one million specimens of more than 700 species are imported annually into Japan from all over the world, some of them illegally. Trade in stag beetles is hugely lucrative—some individuals selling for more than $5000. Prices approaching $100,000 for a single individual have been recorded. This trade is responsible for a destructive illegal trade in many countries, especially in Asia.”  (Pierline)

<br>

The importation of such large quantities of foreign beetles threaten the condition of Japan's original stag beetles as their ecological niche becomes crowded. At the same time, however, enormous growth in beetle markets has resulted in a market net worth of over 100 million U.S. dollars each year. Collectors are estimated to buy  around 15 million specimens each year (Pierline).
<br>A beetle’s body shape and size are the main basis for price determination along with other morphological aspects such as mandible length, thorax width, species rarity and color (Pierline). 

<br>

In 1999, a Dorcus Hopei Binodulosus specimen exceeding a length of 80.2 millimeters was raised by an amateur Japanese breeder in Fukui, Japan. This beetle sold live for 10 million yen to Tokyo’s Ikebukuro district president of a communications company. 10 million yen is about $108,333.33, which is $1,366.48 per millimeter. 
<br>


The reason this Dorcus Hopei Binodulosus specimen sold for such an unbelievable price was because it was the biggest specimen in the world back in 1999. In 1999 it was even rare to see around 70 millimeters of body size, so that specimen earned this species the title of ‘Black diamond’ for its shape and rarity. 
<br>
Experienced beetle breeders are able to grow beetle specimens of nature-defying size which exemplifies the Japanese mastery of this hobby- across the board, the Japanese hold the world records for the largest beetles reared in captivity. Dorcus titanus and Dynastes hercules are two classic species that are commonly reared in Japan and around the globe. 
<br>
Beetle breeding is such an established hobby in Japan that children can buy adult beetles in vending machines and a world record system known as the Guinness BE-KUWA database has been established. BE-KUWA serves as a regulatory institution for beetle breeding records around the world. 

<br>

The domestication of rhinoceros and stag beetles has resulted in specimens that dramatically outsize their wild-bred counterparts. Beetles grow to larger sizes in captivity due to manipulation of the substrate that the breeders provide for the larvae. The substrate contains calcium, yeasts, gut microbes and other additives that allow for the larvae to grow into a larger adult than it would in the wild. In the wild, these nutrients are not as abundant and readily available. Lineages of large specimens can also be established over time which may play a role in the genetic influence on size.
<br>
The world record for the longest beetle ever reared is the 171 mm Hercules beetle reared by Hirofumi Kawano in 2014. As a pupa, it weighed 136g. 

<br>

HirokA's Hercules beetle is currently the longest captive-reared Hercules beetle specimen on earth.
<br>


The largest beetle species on earth, however, are Titanus giganteus and Xixuthrus heros which can grow up to 200 mm in length and have larger body sizes than Hercules beetles.
<br>
Hirofumi Kawano (commonly referred to as HirokA in online forums) produced the largest Hercules beetle ever reared in captivity. As a reminder, an adult male Hercules beetle can lift up to 850 times its own weight. The Hercules beetle is the strongest animal on earth relative to body size.
<br>
Does the longest length on record also imply that HirokA's Hercules beetle is the strongest fighter to have ever existed for its species? Not necessarily. Male Hercules beetles can have different horn-to-body length ratios. Larger horns make up for smaller bodies while larger bodies are stronger and can make up for having smaller horns, but it's safe to assume that this monster could send any other male of his species flipping through the air.

<br>

Rhinoceros beetles can fight each other with so much strength that they can actually snap their own horns and the horns of their enemies, which are mostly made of the powerful arthropod shell compound called chitin.

<br>

Although that would be awesome to watch, a broken horn is extremely bad news for the Hercules beetle. Without a horn to fight other suitors, the Hercules beetle male will only be able to mate with females that aren't near any other males. The entire life cycle and reproductive success of the male Hercules beetle revolves around being successful in battles as an adult.
<br>
Size is usually advantageous when it comes to the mating success of insects but apparently, it's not always better to have the longest horn. According to a scientific study on Xylotrupes gideon, the risk of horn breakage increases with the length of the horn. 
<br>


Horn length does not appear to have any effect on the survival of the individual which suggests that there may be no upper bound for its length. However, a mechanical "Goldilocks" zone may exist where the structural failure of over-sized horns combats the exaggeration of horn length. [1]
<br>


Stag beetles do not have horns to fight each other with. Instead, they use their incredibly over-sized mandibles to heave their opponents into the air. 
<br>
The domestication of the same beetle species in different regions of southeast Asia such as Prosopocoilus giraffa and Dorcus titanus has resulted in several subspecies that differ in things like body proportions, color and shell texture. There are 8 subspecies of Prosopocoilus giraffa and 19 subspecies of Dorcus titanus.
